>
> * The Cookie can affect the resolution of the video files downloaded from the DouYin platform. If you are unable to
    download high-resolution video files, please try updating the Cookie!
>
> * When the program fails to obtain data, you can try updating the Cookie or using a Cookie that is already logged in!

<hr>

## Other Instructions

<ul>
<li>When the program prompts the user for input, pressing Enter directly will return to the previous menu, and inputting <code>Q</code> or <code>q</code> will end the program's execution.</li>
<li>Since fetching data for liked and favorites works of an account only returns the publication dates of those works, not the dates of the actions (liking or favouring), the program needs to retrieve all liked and favorites works data before performing date filtering. If there are a large number of works, this may take a considerable amount of time. The number of requests can be controlled via the <code>max_pages</code> parameter.</li>
<li>To obtain data for posts made by a private account, a logged-in Cookie is required, and the logged-in account must follow the private account.</li>
<li>When batch downloading account posts works or mix works, if the corresponding nickname or mark parameter changes, the program will automatically update the nickname and mark parameter in the file names of the downloaded works.</li>
<li>When downloading files, the program first downloads them to a temporary folder and then moves them to the storage folder upon completion. The temporary folder will be emptied when the program ends.</li>
<li>The <code>Batch Download Favorites Works Mode</code> currently only supports downloading favorited works for the account corresponding to the currently logged-in Cookie and does not support multiple accounts.</li>
<li>If you want the program to use a proxy to request data, you must set the <code>proxy</code> parameter in <code>settings.json</code>; otherwise, the program will not use a proxy.</li>
<li>To exit the program, please end it in a normal way or by pressing Ctrl + C. Do not directly close the terminal window, as this may result in data loss.</li>
<li>If your computer does not have a suitable program for editing JSON files, we recommend using the <a href="https://try8.cn/tool/format/json">JSON Online Tool</a> to edit the configuration file content.</li>
<li>When the program prompts the user to input content or links, please be careful to avoid including newline characters, as this may cause unexpected issues.</li>
<li>This project does not support downloading paid works. Please do not report any issues related to downloading paid works.</li>
<li>On Windows systems, the program needs to be run as an administrator to read Cookies from Chromium, Chrome, and Edge browsers.</li>
<li>This project has not been optimized for running multiple instances of the program. If you need to run multiple instances, please copy the entire project folder to avoid unexpected issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

## Program Update

> **Option 1:** Download and unzip the files, then copy the old version of the `TikTokDownloader.db` file and the
`settings.json` file into the `_internal` folder.

> **Option 2:** Download and unzip the files \(without running the program), then copy all the files and directly
> overwrite the old version files.

2. Find the workflow named **Manual Build of Executable File**
3. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right:
    - Select the **master** or **develop** branch
    - Click **Run workflow**

---

#### 4. Check the Build Progress

1. On the **Actions** page, you can see the execution records of the triggered workflow
2. Click on the run record to view detailed logs to check the build progress and status

---

#### 5. Download the Build Result

2. In the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the page, you will see the built result file
3. Click to download and save it to your local machine to get the built program

---

### Notes

1. **Resource Usage**:
    - GitHub provides free build environments for Actions, with a monthly usage limit (2000 minutes) for free-tier
      users

2. **Code Modifications**:
    - You are free to modify the code in your forked repository to customize the build process
    - After making changes, you can trigger the build process again to get your customized version

3. **Stay in Sync with the Main Repository**:
    - If the main repository is updated with new code or workflows, it is recommended that you periodically sync your
      forked repository to get the latest features and fixes

---

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Please ensure that you have followed the steps to **Enable Actions**. Otherwise, GitHub will prevent the workflow
from running

#### Q2: What should I do if the build process fails?

A:

- Check the run logs to understand the cause of the failure
- Ensure there are no syntax errors or dependency issues in the code
- If the problem persists, please open an issue on
  the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues)

#### Q3: Can I directly use the Actions from the main repository?

A: Due to permission restrictions, you cannot directly trigger Actions from the main repository. Please use the forked
repository to execute the build process
